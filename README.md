😷 Mask Detection using MobileNetV2

This project implements a Face Mask Detection system using the MobileNetV2 architecture — a lightweight and efficient deep learning model optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications.

The goal of the project is to classify whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not.




✅ Project Highlights:

📁 Dataset: A labeled dataset containing images of individuals with and without face masks.

🧠 Model Architecture: Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2, pre-trained on ImageNet.

🧪 Accuracy Achieved: 98% on the test set.

🧰 Techniques Used: Image resizing, normalization, data augmentation, fine-tuning of the MobileNetV2 layers.

🚀 Performance: High accuracy with low inference time — ideal for real-time applications.

🌐 Application: Suitable for deployment in public places like:

Hospitals

Airports

Schools

Workplaces




🔧 Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

MobileNetV2 (pre-trained)

OpenCV

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code



📌 Possible Extensions:

Real-time detection using webcam (OpenCV)

Integration with face detection (e.g. Haar Cascades, MTCNN)

Deployment with Flask or Streamlit for web app
